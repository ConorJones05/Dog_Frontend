2 repos?
Vercel dosent work with python Backends so I deployed that on render so it may run slow becuase I dont have a Pro account meaning they shut down my instances after a while 

If login is not working (works in dev and sometimes in Production other times not, I think this is due to my running the thing off of diffrent services) try this link https://dog-website-techx.vercel.app/admin

Things I would still like to add:
Extra info: added abity to click on each dog but couldnt figure out how to make them all pages

Shopping Cart: llows users to do the delete and could require a schmea that I dont know how to do yet/ would be interesting to do a "blank people have this in the car right now"

Auth: bane of my existance for this project orignaly had it autenitice users with login but thn they would come back to pages nothing would be there so had to scrap it. Subabase very good for this.

Login: Maybe/ Sometimes works sometimes dont. Logs provide to insight as do netorking tab. Very confusing to me
